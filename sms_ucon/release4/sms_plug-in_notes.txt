1. Introduction
If you just want to use the plug-in as soon as possible read at least the
section "4. Installation".

This is version 1.0 of the SMS plug-in.
The versions of RomCenter before 2.62 only support Sega Master System/Game Gear
files in Multi Game Doctor (MGD) format. This plug-in adds support for Super
Magic Drive (SMD) format (it also supports MGD format).

4. Installation
Extract the package with a program like WinZip (http://www.winzip.com/), WinRAR
(http://www.rarlab.com/) or Power Archiver (http://www.powerarchiver.com/).
Put _one_ of the sms.dll files in the plugin directory of RomCenter. If you
are using a version of RomCenter before 2.62 use sms.dll in the directory
2.61. If you are using RomCenter 2.62 (or newer) use sms.dll in the directory
2.62.
Of course you'll also need an appropriate DAT file. This plug-in recognises
both Sega Master System and Game Gear files, but most people want to keep those
files separate. Currently the DAT files that work best with this plug-in are
the ones available from the uCON64 homepage (http://ucon64.sf.net#ucon64dat,
the ones of which the name begins with gg- and sms-). In time they will be
superseded by the ones available from
http://emulationrealm.com/rcdat.php#Cowering_GoodTools.
Although it's possible to use one DLL for both Sega Master System and Game Gear
files, I strongly recommend to copy the DLL and give it a different name for
either Sega Master System files or Game Gear files. For example, if you use
sms.dll for Sega Master System files, copy the file to gg.dll for Game Gear
files. If you want RomCenter to use the plug-in, make sure that the DAT file
contains a line that looks like this:
plugin=sms.dll

Of course, if you gave the file another name, use that one.
This version of the plug-in has a feature that can be used to control what
suffixes the plug-in will suggest for the files that it recognises. If you
place a file named sms.cfg in the same directory as the RomCenter executable
the plug-in will use that file for suffixes. The plug-in recognises the
following "property-lines":
mgd_sms_suffix
mgd_gg_suffix
smd_sms_suffix
smd_gg_suffix

You may use spaces in the suffix. For example:
smd_sms_suffix=.Super Magic Drive

Note that by default, the plug-in suggests a suffix that indicates the console
a file belongs to, as opposed to a suffix that indicates the format. The
plug-in suggests the suffix .sms for SMS files and the suffix .gg for GG files,
whether their format is MGD or SMD. If you want to change this behaviour use a
configuration file.


5. Compiling the plug-in
You don't need to compile the plug-in unless you are a software developer and
want to change or fix something.
To compile the plug-in use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com), MinGW
(http://www.mingw.org) or Visual C++. Cygwin and MinGW are ports of GCC. They
are free. If you are using Cygwin or MinGW just type "make". If you don't use
MSYS (port of Bash) for MinGW you have to modify the makefile.
Please note: It appears that not all versions of Cygwin can be used to compile
a working plug-in. If Cygwin doesn't work for you, just use MinGW.
To compile the plug-in with Visual C++ (version 6) type "nmake /f Makefile.vc6"
on the command line (after you've run VCVARS32.BAT once).
By default the plug-in will be compiled for RomCenter 2.62. If you want to
compile the plug-in for older versions you have to make the following changes
to the source code and makefiles.

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW:
- Open Makefile in an editor and remove the hash symbol ('#') in front of line
  4.

If you're using Visual C++:
- Open Makefile.vc6 in an editor and put a hash symbol ('#') in front of line
  1.
- Remove the hash symbol in front of line 2.

The changes are necessary, because RomCenter 2.62 uses a different plug-in API
compared to previous versions. The difference is that the exported functions
should now have the prefix "rc_". RomCenter 2.62 has been changed, because it
required some ugly work-arounds to be able to compile a plug-in that is written
in C. To be more specific, the old RomCenter plug-in API specification requires
that there is a function GetVersion() in the plug-in. However, the Win32 API
already contains a function with the same signature and thus compiling a
plug-in with a C-compiler would in most circumstances generate a conflict. If
not at compile-time then at link-time.
