These plugins were tested using actual Good* tools data,
extracted from the good*.exe file.  Only a few files (6
files out of 13 tested tools with thousands of ROMs) do
not match the good* tools implementation, meaning that
it is at least as good as the good* tool.  Of course,
this will not make a difference if the same .dll file is
used to make the .dat files.

All .dll files still need to be tested with a .dat file
maker as well as with RomCenter itself.  Status report
follows, let me know if I am missing a Good* tool.

for compatibility with TUGID (tosec.org) do not change
the plugin names.  TUGID does not use the .dll, but I gave
the header algos to Archie so TUGID uses them if it sees
the plugin name in the .dat file.  Thanks to Archie and
TOSEC for adding these.

Changes:
	A7800 does not use Cowering's algorithm, for better
	preservation of accurate header data.
	SNES is impossible to test against goodsnes data
