1. Introduction
If you just want to use the plug-in as soon as possible read at least the
section "4. Installation".

This is version 1.2 of the SNES plug-in.
The original SNES plug-in that comes with versions of RomCenter before 2.62
lacks some features. The main ones being:
- support for interleaved ROM dumps
- proper detection of backup unit header
- correct suffix ("extension") for format
- CRC32 calculation for BS dumps according to the uCONSRT "standard"

uCON64 (http://ucon64.sourceforge.net) has these features. I'm one of the
programmers of uCON64 and decided to make a RomCenter plug-in based on the SNES
detection and analysis code of uCON64.

This plug-in detects files in Super Wild Card, Super Pro Fighter, Game Doctor
SF3/SF6/SF7, Super UFO and Multi Game Hunter/Doctor format. In addition to that
it detects some incorrect (as in made-up) formats like interleaved LoROM files.


2. Version history
1.0     Initial release
1.1     - Fixed bug that caused some non-interleaved ROM dumps to be detected
          as interleaved, depending on the current locale settings.
        - Fixed a problem with the header detection code.
        Thanks to Mike <thegoon@rogers.com> for reporting these bugs.
1.2     - Fixed several issues with detection code.
        Thanks to Dweezledap <emulation@emulationrealm.com> for reporting these
        bugs and for testing.
        - ROMs with an NSRT header, but with a modified internal name are now
          handled correctly, i.e., they are handled as if they weren't
          modified (if the NSRT header contains correct data).

4. Installation
Extract the package with a program like WinZip (http://www.winzip.com/), WinRAR
(http://www.rarlab.com/) or Power Archiver (http://www.powerarchiver.com/).
Put _one_ of the snes.dll files in the plugin directory of RomCenter. If you
are using a version of RomCenter before 2.62 use snes.dll in the directory
2.61. If you are using RomCenter 2.62 (or newer) use snes.dll in the directory
2.62.
Of course you'll also need an appropriate DAT file. Currently the best
available SNES DAT file can be obtained from
http://emulationrealm.com/rcdat.php#Cowering_GoodTools
This version of the plug-in has a feature that can be used to control what
suffixes the plug-in will give to the files that it recognises. If you place a
file named snes.cfg in the same directory as the RomCenter executable the
plug-in will use that file for suffixes. For example, some people don't like
the fact that the plug-in gives headerless files the suffix ".mgd", but prefer
the suffix ".bin" instead. They should add a line to snes.cfg that looks like
mgd_suffix=.bin
The plug-in recognises the following "property-lines":
mgd_suffix
gd3_suffix
ufo_suffix
fig_suffix
swc_suffix
smc_suffix

Don't use spaces before the '='. You may use spaces in the suffix. For example:
swc_suffix=.Super Wild Card


5. Compiling the plug-in
You don't need to compile the plug-in unless you are a software developer and
want to change or fix something.
To compile the plug-in use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com), MinGW
(http://www.mingw.org) or Visual C++. Cygwin and MinGW are ports of GCC. They
are free. If you are using Cygwin or MinGW just type "make". If you don't use
MSYS (port of Bash) for MinGW you have to modify the makefile.
Please note: It appears that not all versions of Cygwin can be used to compile
a working plug-in. If Cygwin doesn't work for you, just use MinGW.
To compile the plug-in with Visual C++ (version 6) type "nmake /f Makefile.vc6"
on the command line (after you've run VCVARS32.BAT once).
By default the plug-in will be compiled for RomCenter 2.62. If you want to
compile the plug-in for older versions you have to make the following changes
to the source code and makefiles.

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW:
- Open Makefile in an editor and remove the hash symbol ('#') in front of line
  4.

If you're using Visual C++:
- Open Makefile.vc6 in an editor and put a hash symbol ('#') in front of line
  1.
- Remove the hash symbol ('#') in front of line 2.

The changes are necessary, because RomCenter 2.62 uses a different plug-in API
compared to previous versions. The difference is that the exported functions
should now have the prefix "rc_". RomCenter 2.62 has been changed, because it
required some ugly work-arounds to be able to compile a plug-in that is written
in C. To be more specific, the old RomCenter plug-in API specification requires
that there is a function GetVersion() in the plug-in. However, the Win32 API
already contains a function with the same signature and thus compiling a
plug-in with a C-compiler would in most circumstances generate a conflict. If
not at compile-time then at link-time.


5.1. Some remarks about the source code
You might ask why there are some references to uCON64-specific things in the
source code. The main reason is that I don't want to spend much time
maintaining the source code of this plug-in while it is possible to let it
share most code with uCON64. The SNES code in uCON64 has been thoroughly
tested, so the plug-in will probably work well. The more things I change
compared to the code in uCON64 the higher the chance I break something.


6. Bugs and problems
In case the plug-in fails to detect a certain ROM dump or demo of which you
know for certain that GoodSNES 2.04 detects it, please try NSRT
(http://nsrt.edgeemu.com or http://www.geocities.com/joecool22us/mirror.htm)
and uCON64 and see if they do detect the file correctly. You can also try to
convert the file with uCON64 to Super Wild Card format. To convert the file
nicegame.smc to Super Wild Card format type this on the command line:
  ucon64 -swc nicegame.smc
and see if the plug-in then recognises nicegame.swc (note the suffix). Don't
forget what I wrote in the section "4. Installation".
*Please* don't contact me about demos or SNES files in the public domain.
Please don't contact me about hacked files or bad dumps either. Please *do*
contact me about problems with redumped cartridges.
If you find a bug or some other problem with this plug-in, feel free to contact
me. You can contact me via dbjh@users.sourceforge.net.
