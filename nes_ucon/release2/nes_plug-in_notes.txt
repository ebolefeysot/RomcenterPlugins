1. Introduction
If you just want to use the plug-in as soon as possible read at least the
section "4. Installation".

This is version 1.1 of the NES plug-in.
The original NES plug-in only detects NES files in iNES format. This plug-in
recognises files in iNES, UNIF, Pasofami, FFE, FDS and FAM format.


2. Version history
1.0     Initial release
1.1     - Changed detection code for iNES files. Instead of testing for
        "NES\x1a" the plug-in now tests for "NES". This makes the plug-in
        recognise two iNES files with incorrect iNES headers that are floating
        around on the internet:
        "Home Alone 2 - Lost in New York (U) [b3]" (magic: "NES\x19") and
        "Linus Music Demo (PD)" (magic: "NES\x1b")
        Thanks to HeYing for reporting this on the RomCenter Datafiles forum.

4. Installation
Extract the package with a program like WinZip (http://www.winzip.com/), WinRAR
(http://www.rarlab.com/) or Power Archiver (http://www.powerarchiver.com/).
Put _one_ of the nes.dll files in the plugin directory of RomCenter. If you
are using a version of RomCenter before 2.62 use nes.dll in the directory 2.61.
If you are using RomCenter 2.62 (or newer) use nes.dll in the directory 2.62.
Use the NES DAT file available from the uCON64 homepage
(http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/#ucon64dat). Expect some file renaming problems
if you use the NES DAT file available from Rob van der Drift's homepage
(http://gooddat.emu-france.com/). The latter NES DAT file instructs RomCenter
to use the plug-in nes11b.dll. If you want RomCenter to use the new plug-in
(nes.dll) in combination with that DAT file edit the file so that this line
plugin=nes11b.dll
looks like this
plugin=nes.dll

This version of the plug-in has a feature that can be used to control what
suffixes the plug-in will give to the files that it recognises. If you place a
file named nes.cfg in the same directory as the RomCenter executable the
plug-in will use that file for suffixes. The plug-in recognises the following
"property-lines":
ines_suffix
unif_suffix
pasofami_prm_suffix
pasofami_prg_suffix
pasofami_chr_suffix
ffe_suffix
fds_suffix
fam_suffix

Don't use spaces before the '='. You may use spaces in the suffix. For example:
fds_suffix=.Famicom Disk System


5. Compiling the plug-in
You don't need to compile the plug-in unless you are a software developer and
want to change or fix something.
To compile the plug-in use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com), MinGW
(http://www.mingw.org) or Visual C++. Cygwin and MinGW are ports of GCC. They
are free. If you are using Cygwin or MinGW just type "make". If you don't use
Msys (port of Bash for MinGW) you have to modify the makefile.
To compile the plug-in with Visual C++ (version 6) type "nmake /f Makefile.vc6"
on the command line (after you've run VCVARS32.BAT once).
By default the plug-in will be compiled for RomCenter 2.62. If you want to
compile the plug-in for older versions you have to make the following changes
to the source code and makefiles.

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW:
- Change line 57 of Makefile into
	cp $(LIBNAME).old.def tmp.def

  Be sure to save the tab character(s) or make will complain.
- Remove the hash symbol ('#') in front of line 58.

If you're using Visual C++:
- Put a hash symbol ('#') in front of line 1 of Makefile.vc6.
- Change line 17 into
DLLFLAGS=/NOLOGO /DLL $(OBJECTS) $(LIBS) /DEF:$(LIBNAME).old.def /OUT:$(LIBNAME).dll

Regardless of the compiler you're using, remove the two slashes in front of
line 39 of main.c so that the constant RC261_COMPATIBILITY will be defined.

The changes are necessary, because RomCenter 2.62 uses a different plug-in API
compared to previous versions. The difference is that the exported functions
should now have the prefix "rc_". RomCenter 2.62 has been changed, because it
required some ugly work-arouds to be able to compile a plug-in that is written
in C. To be more specific, the old RomCenter plug-in API specification requires
that there is a function GetVersion() in the plug-in. However, the Win32 API
already contains a function with the same signature and thus compiling a
plug-in with a C-compiler would in most circumstances generate a conflict. If
not at compile-time then at link-time.


6. Bugs and problems
The plug-in uses the suffix of Pasofami files in order to recognise them. It
uses hardcoded suffixes (.prm, .prg and .chr), not the ones specified in the
configuration file. So, with this version it's best to not specify other
suffixes for Pasofami files.
